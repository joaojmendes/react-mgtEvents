# react-mgt-events

 ##  Sample to show hou to use MGT (Microsoft Graph ToolKit) components in SPFx React and custom render with Fluent-UI Controls.

 Note:

 To run this sample :

You must run on you Tenant not local host, because the permissions required for Microsft Graph
You first add the required permissions to use <mgt-agenda> and <mgt-person>
you can check  here :

"Person Control":

  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/toolkit/components/person?view=graph-rest-1.0

 <br/>
 "Agenda Control"
 
 https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/toolkit/components/agenda?view=graph-rest-1.0

 use microsoft365Cli or PnPPowershell to add permissions to service principal and run in you Tenant.

 This is a very sample use of  MGT. anf show how is to implement and use with little lines of code. :)


Thank you very much.
